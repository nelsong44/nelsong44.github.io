      <h2>professional summary</h2>
    </div>
      <p>Holding strong interests in creative processes and hands-on interaction, I am
looking to carry these interests from manufacturing to a career in Information Technology. Being traditionally
trained in art-making and design, and now beginning the study of full-stack web development, I am eager to
combine and further develop both skill sets within a role I can master long-term. I have been consistently complimented on my
insatiable passion for learning, inquisitive nature and motivating demeanor. Fortunately, these qualities have
allowed me to climb within my positions and be offered additional training and leadership roles quickly.</p>
